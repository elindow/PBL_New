  14 |  10 |    1 | Wes bought some school supplies at an outlet store in Maine, a state that has a 6.5% sales tax. Including the sales tax, how much did Wes pay for two blazers priced at $49.95 each and 3 pairs of pants priced at $17.50 each?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-07 06:29:17.415032 | 2014-07-07 06:29:17.415032 | ((2 * 49.95) + ( 3 * 17.50)) * 1.065 = 162.31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                         | 
  15 |  11 |    1 | (Continuation) A familiar feature of arithmetic is that multiplication distributes over addition. Written in algebraic code, this property looks like a(b+c) = ab+ac. Because of this property, there are two equivalent methods that can be used to compute the answer in the previous problem. Explain, using words and complete sentences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-07 06:31:19.432972 | 2014-07-07 06:31:19.432972 | You can either find the price of each individual item and figure the tax, or you can find the pre-tax total and then figure the tax.

  18 |   4 |    2 | When describing the growth of a population, the passage of time is sometimes described in generations, a generation being about 30 years. One generation ago, you had two ancestors (your parents). Two generations ago, you had four ancestors (your grandparents). Ninety years ago, you had eight ancestors (your great-grandparents). How many ancestors did you have 300 years ago? 900 years ago?

  44 |   5 |    5 | Here is another number puzzle: Pick a number, add 5 and multiply the result by 4. Add another 5 and multiply the result by 4 again. Subtract 100 from your result and divide your answer by 8. How does your answer compare to the original number? You may need to do a couple of examples like this until you see the pattern.

  29 |   4 |    3 | To buy a ticket for a weekly state lottery, a person selects 6 integers from 1 to 36, the order not being important. There are 1947792 such combinations of six digits. Alex and nine friends want to win the lottery by buying every possible ticket (all 1947792 combinations), and plan to spend 16 hours a day doing it.

  33 |   1 |    4 | At 186282 miles per second, how far does light travel in a year? Give your answer in miles, but use scientific notation, which expresses a number like 93400000 as 9:34 × 10^7 (which might appear on your calculator as 9.34 E7 instead). A year is approximately 365.25 days. The answer to this question is called a light year by astronomers, who use it to measure huge distances. Other than the Sun, the star nearest the Earth is Proxima Centauri, a mere 4.2 light years away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Approximation due to length of year being inexact                                                                                                                  | 2014-07-08 22:17:25.898376 | 2014-07-08 22:17:36.68604  | 186282 * 60 * 50 *24 *365.25 = 5,878,612,843,200\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +|                         |

  59 |   1 |    7 | In baseball statistics, a player’s slugging ratio is defined to be (s + 2d + 3t + 4h)/b, where s is the number of singles, d the number of doubles, t the number of triples and h the number of home runs obtained in b times at bat. Dana came to bat 75 times during the season, and hit 12 singles, 4 doubles, 2 triples, and 8 home runs.

  71 |   1 |    8 | The distributive property states that (−1)x + 1x is the same as (−1 + 1)x, and this is 0. It follows that (−1)x is the same as −x. Explain why, then use similar reasoning to explain why (−x)y is the same as −(xy). By the way, is it correct to say, “−x is a negative number”?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-10 19:15:29.213407 | 2014-07-10 19:15:29.213407 | Since x + (-x)  = 0, -x must be the same as (-1)x.\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +|                         |

  85 |   4 |    9 | The length of a certain rectangle exceeds its width by exactly 8 cm, and the perimeter of the rectangle is 66 cm. What is the width of the rectangle? Although you may be able to solve this problem using a method of your own, try the following approach, which starts by guessing the width of the rectangle. Study the first row of the table below, which is based on a 10-cm guess for the width. Then make your own guess and use it to fill in the next row of the table.

  89 |   3 |   10 | At West Point, the “plebe” (first year cadet) who brings dessert to the table must divide it into pieces that are exactly the size requested by the cadets at the table.

  92 |   6 |   10 | Day student Avery just bought 10 gallons of gasoline, the amount of fuel used for the last 355 miles of driving. Being a curious sort, Avery wondered how much fuel had been used in city driving (which takes one gallon for every 25 miles) and how much had been used in freeway driving (which takes one gallon for each 40 miles). Avery started by guessing 6 gallons for the city driving, then completed the first row of the guess-and-check table below. Notice the failed check. Make your own guess and use it to fill in the next row of the table.\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +|                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-11 22:02:17.528748 | 2014-07-11 22:02:17.528748 | city g     freeway g      city mi      freeway mi      total mi       target      check\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +|                         |

  99 |   6 |   11 | Sam and Cam have a lawn-mowing service. Their first job tomorrow morning is one that usually takes Sam 40 minutes to do alone, or Cam 30 minutes to do alone. This time they are going to team up, Sam starting at one side and Cam at the other side. The problem is to predict how many minutes it will take them to finish the job. What part of the lawn will Sam complete in the first ten minutes? What part of the lawn will Cam complete in the first ten minutes? What part of the lawn will the team complete in ten minutes? Set up a guess-and-check table with columns titled “minutes”, “Sam part”, “Cam part” and “Team part”. What is the target value for the team part? Fill in two rows of the chart by making guesses in the minutes column. Then guess m and complete the solution algebraically. |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-12 15:17:31.626605 | 2014-07-12 15:17:31.626605 | Minutes     Sam Part       Cam Part      Team Part     Target    Met?\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +|                         |

How many members did the club have last year?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-12 20:20:48.716226 | 2014-07-12 20:20:48.716226 | b = g this year \r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +|                         |

 135 |   1 |   16 | The statement “x is between 13 and 23” defines an interval using two simultaneous inequalities: 13 < x and x < 23. The statement “x is not between 13 and 23” also uses two inequalities, but they are non-simultaneous: x ≤ 13 or 23 ≤ x. Graph these two examples on a number line. Notice that there is a compact form 13 < x < 23 for only one of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Unclear whether to use o or *, depends on the meaning of between- inclusive or exclusive?                                                                          | 2014-07-14 04:23:19.106744 | 2014-07-14 04:30:11.39089  | a) ---|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----o====|=========|=========|=========|=========|====o----|---------|---------|----\r                                                                                                                                                                                                   +|                         |

 150 |   8 |   17 | Alden paid to have some programs printed for the football game last weekend. The printing cost per program was 54 cents, and the plan was to sell them for 75 cents each. Poor weather kept many fans away from the game, however, so unlucky Alden was left with 100 unsold copies, and lost $12 on the venture.

 163 |   4 |   19 | (Continuation) The slope of a line is a measure of how steep the line is. It is calculated by dividing the change in y-coordinates by the corresponding change in x-coordinates between two points on the line: slope = change in y/change in x. Calculate the slope of the line that goes through the two points (1, 3) and (7. 6). Calculate the slope of the line that goes through the two points (0, 0) and (9, 6).

 172 |   5 |   20 | Eugene and Wes are solving the inequality 132−4x ≤ 36. Each begins by subtracting 132 from both sides to get −4x ≤ −96, and then each divides both sides by −4. Eugene gets x ≤ 24 and Wes gets x ≥ 24, however. Always happy to offer advice, Alex now suggests to Eugene and Wes that answers to inequalities can often be checked by substituting x = 0 into both the original inequality and the answer. What do you think of this advice? Graph each of these answers on a number line.

 173 |   6 |   20 | (Continuation) After hearing Alex’s suggestion about using a test value to check an inequality, Cameron suggests that the problem could have been done by solving the equation 132 − 4x = 36 first.

You then know it goes right because 132 - (4*x) has to be less than 32, which requires a larger x.                                                                                                                                                                         |                         | 
 174 |   7 |   20 | (Continuation) Deniz, who has been keeping quiet during the discussion, remarks,“The only really tricky thing about inequalities is when you try to multiply them or divide them by negative numbers, but this kind of step can be avoided altogether. Cameron just told us one way to avoid it, and there is another way, too.” Explain this remark by Deniz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-16 20:20:31.684823 | 2014-07-16 20:25:37.164622 | Add 4x to both sides, then it isn't necessary to divide by a negative number:\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       +|                         |

 199 |   1 |   23 | If you graph the line y = 0.5x+3 on your calculator, it is likely that both axis intercepts are visible. If you try to graph y = 0.1x + 18 on your calculator, it is quite likely that the axis intercepts are not both visible. What are the axis intercepts? Describe how to set the calculator’s “window” so that they both become visible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-19 15:03:02.41032  | 2014-07-24 16:57:20.433463 | Graph attached. \r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +|                         | PBL_ans_23_1.PNG

 203 |   5 |   23 | Drivers in distress near Exeter have two towing services to choose from: Brook’s Body Shop charges $3 per mile for the towing, and a fixed $25 charge regardless of the length of the tow. Morgan Motors charges a flat $5 per mile. On the same system of axes, represent each of these choices by a linear graph that plots the cost of the tow versus the length of the tow.

 211 |   1 |   24 | Day student Morgan left home at 7:00 one morning, determined to make the ten-mile trip to PEA on bicycle for a change. Soon thereafter, a parent noticed forgotten math homework on the kitchen table, got into the family car, and tried to catch up with the forgetful child. Morgan had a fifteen-minute head start, and was pedaling at 12 mph, while the parent pursued at 30 mph. Was Morgan reunited with the homework before reaching PEA that day? If so, where? If not, at what time during first period (math, which starts at 8:00) was the homework delivered?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-19 20:32:10.359087 | 2014-07-19 20:32:10.359087 | Morgan = 7 + 10/12 = 7.833 arr school ~7:50\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +|                         |

 234 |   5 |   26 | A friend suggested that I change my cellphone company. This new company has a fixed monthly charge of $39.99, but it charges only 12 cents for each text message.

 246 |   7 |   27 | What is the distance between 6 and −6? between 24 and 17? between 17 and 24? between t and 4? The distance between two points is always positive. If a and b are two points on a number line, the distance is therefore either a − b or b − a, whichever is non-negative. This is an example of an absolute-value calculation, and the result is written |a − b|.

 145 |   3 |   17 | Sandy recently made a 210-mile car trip, starting from home at noon. The graph at right shows how Sandy’s distance from home (measured in miles) depends on the number of hours after noon. Make up a story that accounts for the four distinct parts of the graph. In particular, identify the speed at which Sandy spent most of the afternoon driving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-14 19:39:31.026864 | 2014-07-24 16:44:56.528467 | For the first hour Sandy was in local traffic averaging 30 mpg. Then she got on the highway and was able to average 60 mph. She stopped for food after 2 hours and spent 1 hour. Then she drove 2 more hours on the freeway at 60 mph. So for the majority of the day she was driving at 60 mph, although her average speed was only a bit over 40 for the whole trip. | PBL_Graph_17_3.PNG      |

 288 |   3 |   31 | Pat and Kim are operating a handcar on the railroad tracks. It is hard work, and it takes an hour to cover each mile. Their big adventure starts at 8 am at Rockingham Junction, north of Exeter. They reach the Main St crossing in Exeter at noon, and finish their ride in Kingston at 3 pm.

 290 |   5 |   31 | (Continuation) Let y be the distance between the handcar and the Newfields Road bridge, which Pat and Kim reach at 11 am. Draw a graph that plots y versus t, for the entire interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 7. Write an equation that expresses y in terms of t. By the way, you have probably noticed that each of these absolute-value graphs has a corner point, which is called a 'vertex'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-07-28 01:34:09.399904 | 2014-07-28 01:34:09.399904 | t   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   +|                         | PBL_ans_31_5.PNG

 317 |   8 |   33 | As anyone knows who has hiked up a mountain, the higher you go, the cooler the temperature gets. At noon on July 4th last summer, the temperature at the top of Mt. Washington—elevation 6288 feet—was 56◦F. The temperature at base camp in Pinkham Notch — elevation 2041 feet — was 87◦F. It was a clear, still day. At that moment, a group of hikers reached Tuckerman Junction — elevation 5376 feet. To the nearest degree, calculate the temperature the hikers were experiencing at that time and place.

Let x be the distance from Buzzardtown, measured along the road (so 0 ≤ x ≤ 20), and y be the distance to the nearest gas station. Make a table of values that includes entries for x = 7, x = 9, and x = 16, and then draw a graph of y versus x. The graph should have a vertex at (10; 10).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-08-01 00:07:15.872341 | 2014-08-01 00:08:19.16334  | x   0   7   9  16  20\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +|                         | PBL_ans_35_9.PNG

Since we're working in minutes, we divide 30/60, to get a speed of 1/2 miles per minute.

I would be more accurate to say the slope is 0, since the change in y for a given x is 0. If they are talking about a vertical line, it is fair to say there is no slope, as finding a slope would require dividing by zero.                                                                                              |                         |

Notice that it does not make sense to connect the dots in this context, because x and y are discrete variables, whose values are limited to integers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-08-01 03:12:53.785287 | 2014-08-01 03:13:42.594535 | 10y + 25x = 100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                         | PBL_ans_37_2.PNG

 376 |  11 |   38 | A hot-air balloon ride has been set up so that a paying customer is carried straight up at 50 feet per minute for ten minutes and then immediately brought back to the ground at the same rate. The whole ride lasts twenty minutes. Let h be the height of the balloon (in feet) and t be the number of minutes since the ride began. Draw a graph of h versus t. What are the coordinates of the vertex?

 377 |   1 |   39 | Fitness Universe has a membership fee of $50, after which individual visits to the gym are $5.50. Non-members pay $8.00 per visit. Stuart is going to exercise at the gym regularly, and is wondering whether it makes sense to become a member. How regularly would Stuart need to visit this gym, in order for a membership to be worth it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                    | 2014-08-02 00:55:39.522721 | 2014-08-02 00:55:39.522721 | 5.5v + 50 < 8v\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +|                         |

 394 |   7 |   40 | The diagram at right shows a rectangle that has been cut into nine square pieces, no two being the same size. Given that the smallest piece is 2 cm by 2 cm, figure out the sizes of the other eight pieces. A good strategy is to start by guessing the size of one of the pieces adjacent to the smallest piece.

 399 |   4 |   41 | Jess and Wes used to race each other when they were younger. Jess could cover 8 meters per second, but Wes could cover only 5 meters per second, so Jess would sportingly let Wes start 60 meters ahead. They would both start at the same time and continue running until Jess caught up with Wes.
