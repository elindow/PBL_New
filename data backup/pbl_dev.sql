14	10	1	Wes bought some school supplies at an outlet store in Maine, a state that has a 6.5% sales tax. Including the sales tax, how much did Wes pay for two blazers priced at $49.95 each and 3 pairs of pants priced at $17.50 each?		2014-07-07 06:29:17.415032	2014-07-07 06:29:17.415032	((2 * 49.95) + ( 3 * 17.50)) * 1.065 = 162.31
15	11	1	(Continuation) A familiar feature of arithmetic is that multiplication distributes over addition. Written in algebraic code, this property looks like a(b+c) = ab+ac. Because of this property, there are two equivalent methods that can be used to compute the answer in the previous problem. Explain, using words and complete sentences.		2014-07-07 06:31:19.432972	2014-07-07 06:31:19.432972	You can either find the price of each individual item and figure the tax, or you can find the pre-tax total and then figure the tax. It ends up the same due to the distributive property.
16	2	2	Pick any number. Add 4 to it and then double your answer. Now subtract 6 from that result and divide your new answer by 2. Write down your answer. Repeat these steps with another number. Continue with a few more numbers, comparing your final answer with your original number. Is there a pattern to your answers?		2014-07-07 14:57:52.426665	2014-07-07 14:57:52.426665	1 -> 2\r\n2 -> 3\r\n100 -> 101\r\n\r\n(2(x+4)-6)/2\r\n(2x+2)/2\r\nx+1
17	3	2	Using the four integers 2, 3, 6 and 8 once each — in any order — and three arithmetic operations selected from among addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, write expressions whose values are the target numbers given below. You will probably need to use parentheses. For example, to hit the target 90, you could write 90 = (3 + 6) · (8 + 2). \r\n\r\n(a) 3 (b) 24 (c) 36 (d) 30	Trial and error/Pattern building\r\nSee what other numbers can be made from pairs, triplets	2014-07-07 15:12:05.863401	2014-07-07 15:12:05.863401	(a)  2+3+6-8 = 3\r\n(b) (3*6)-2+8 = 24\r\n(c) (2*6*9)/3 = 36\r\n(d) ((2*8)-6)*3 = 30
3	1	2	Woolworth’s had a going-out-of-business sale. The price of a telephone before the sale was $39.98. What was the price of the telephone after a 30% discount? If the sale price of the same telephone had been $23.99, what would the (percentage) discount have been?	Percentage review	2014-02-14 17:14:06.59592	2014-07-05 06:08:14.346362	39.99 * .7,\r\n\r\n(39.99-23.99)/39.99
1	1	1	Light travels at about 186 thousand miles per second, and the Sun is about 93 million miles from the Earth. How much time does light take to reach the Earth from the Sun?		2014-02-14 17:13:05.764503	2014-07-05 06:14:52.00225	93,000,000/186,000 = # of seconds it takes = 500\r\n500/60 = 8 minutes 20 seconds
2	2	1	How long would it take you to count to one billion, reciting the numbers one after another? First write a guess into your notebook, then come up with a thoughtful answer. One approach is to actually do it and have someone time you, but there are more manageable alternatives. What assumptions did you make in your calculations?	Easy to make mistakes when dealing with very large numbers.	2014-02-14 17:13:41.019212	2014-07-05 06:21:24.866224	It's going to take a long time, since almost all of the numbers are greater than 1 million and it takes several seconds just to say one very large number. If the average number takes about 5 seconds, it would take around 5 billion seconds. 5,000,000,000/(60*60*24*365) gives an estimate of about 158 years.
7	3	1	It takes 1.25 seconds for light to travel from the Moon to the Earth. How many miles away is the Moon?	The orbit is elliptical, not round, so this is at best an approximation, or more strictly speaking the distance from the earth to the moon isn't a constant value.	2014-07-07 05:52:27.924879	2014-07-07 05:52:27.924879	186000*1.25=232,500 miles
8	4	1	Many major-league baseball pitchers can throw the ball at 90 miles per hour. At that \r\nspeed, how long does it take a pitch to travel from the pitcher’s mound to home plate, a distance of 60 feet 6 inches? Give your answer to the nearest hundredth of a second. There are 5280 feet in a mile.	What's the difference in time for a 79mph curveball?	2014-07-07 06:01:42.069819	2014-07-07 06:02:08.124077	90mph*5280 = 475,200fph/60  = 7920fpm/60 = 132 fps\r\n132/60.5 = 2.18 seconds\r\n
9	5	1	You have perhaps heard the saying, “A journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step.” How many steps would you take to finish a journey of 1000 miles? What information do you need in order to answer this question? Find a reasonable answer. What would your answer be if the journey were 1000 kilometers?	Again, values are under the control of the stepper.	2014-07-07 06:06:28.481688	2014-07-07 06:06:28.481688	How long is a step? Estimate 2.5 feet per step.\r\n5280/2.5 = 2,112 steps per mile, or 2,112,000 for a thousand miles.\r\nI km = ~.625 miles, so ~1,320,000 steps for 1,000 km. 
10	6	1	In an offshore pipeline, a cylindrical mechanism called a “pig” is run through the pipes periodically to clean them. These pigs travel at 2 feet per second. What is this speed, expressed in miles per hour?		2014-07-07 06:15:33.530602	2014-07-07 06:15:33.530602	2 fps = 2 * 60 * 60 or 7200 fph.\r\n7200/5280 = 1.3636 mph.
11	7	1	Your class sponsors a benefit concert and prices the tickets at $8 each. Dale sells 12 tickets, Andy 16, Morgan 17, and Pat 13. Compute the total revenue brought in by these four persons. Notice that there are two ways to do the calculation.		2014-07-07 06:19:03.256325	2014-07-07 06:19:03.256325	(12+15+17+13) * 8 or\r\n12*8 + 16*8 + 17*8 + 13*8\r\n$464
12	8	1	Kelly telephoned Brook about a homework problem. Kelly said, “Four plus three times two is 14, isn’t it?” Brook replied, “No, it’s 10.” Did someone make a mistake? Can you explain where these two answers came from?		2014-07-07 06:21:54.709149	2014-07-07 06:21:54.709149	Depends on order of operations, without parentheses it isn't clear if it is (4+3)*2 or 4+(3*2), though the latter could be argued to be correct under strict PEMDAS interpretation.
13	9	1	It is customary in algebra to omit multiplication symbols whenever possible. For example, 11x means the same thing as 11 · x. Which of the following can be condensed by leaving out a multiplication symbol? (a) 4 · 1/3  (b) 1.08 · p (c) 24 · 52 (d) 5 · (2 + x)\r\n	a would look like 4.33\r\nc would look like 2452	2014-07-07 06:26:23.749204	2014-07-07 15:44:01.833295	b - 1.08p\r\nd - 5(2+x)\r\n
