92	6	10	Day student Avery just bought 10 gallons of gasoline, the amount of fuel used for the last 355 miles of driving. Being a curious sort, Avery wondered how much fuel had been used in city driving (which takes one gallon for every 25 miles) and how much had been used in freeway driving (which takes one gallon for each 40 miles). Avery started by guessing 6 gallons for the city driving, then completed the first row of the guess-and-check table below. Notice the failed check. Make your own guess and use it to fill in the next row of the table.\r\n\r\ncity g     freeway g      city mi      freeway mi      total mi       target      check\r\n   6       10 - 6 = 4   6(25) = 150   4(40) = 160   150 + 160 = 310    355         no\r\n\r\nNow write c in the city-gallon column, fill in the remaining entries in terms of c, and\r\nset your expression for the total mileage equal to the target mileage.

Multiplying them gives the area. So if you count up the numbers of the various types of objects formed when you make a rectangle out of algebra blocks, you have effectively multiplied the two terms.

Knowing that Dale liked a mathematical challenge, Hill demonstrated how it was possible to use the plant (which was rooted to the bottom of the pond) to calculate the depth of the water under the boat. Without uprooting it, Hill gently pulled the plant sideways, causing it to disappear at a point that was 35 inches from its original position. The top of the plant originally stood 5 inches above the water surface.

317	8	33	As anyone knows who has hiked up a mountain, the higher you go, the cooler the temperature gets. At noon on July 4th last summer, the temperature at the top of Mt. Washington—elevation 6288 feet—was 56◦F. The temperature at base camp in Pinkham Notch — elevation 2041 feet — was 87◦F. It was a clear, still day. At that moment, a group of hikers reached Tuckerman Junction — elevation 5376 feet. To the nearest degree, calculate the temperature the hikers were experiencing at that time and place. When you decided how to model this situation, what assumptions did you make?	Great problem.	2014-07-29 20:26:12.471885	2015-12-07 15:07:18.383811	Change in temperature-  87-56, or 31 degrees cooler\r\nChange in altitude-   6288-2041, or 4247 feet difference\r\n4247/31 means the temperature goes down about 1 degree for each additional 137 feet of elevation.  \r\nTuckerman Junction is 5376-2041 feet above Pinkham Notch, or 3335 feet of additional altitude. 3335/137 would subtract about 24.3 degrees from the base temp of 87, making it about 63 degrees at Tuckerman.\r\nThis assumes that the decrease in temperature is constant as altitude increases, which probably isn't the case, since the local recorded temperature can be affected by many factors including wind and amount of sunshine.	\N	\N	63◦ F	Sydney K.		1
346	1	36	Sandy was told by a friend that “absolute value makes everything positive.” So Sandy rewrote the equation |x − 6| = 5 as x + 6 = 5. Do you agree with the statement, or with what Sandy did to the equation? Explain your answer.		2014-08-01 01:10:13.47576	2015-12-11 17:30:29.340503	No, absolute value makes the result of what is inside the vertical lines positive, but that doesn't mean that 'everything' is positive, just the result. So even though x + 6 = 5 gives one of the solutions, -1, it loses the other solution, 1, which results when the -5 result of 1-6 is changed to positive.	\N	\N	incorrect, multiple solutions			1

581	1	61	When I ask my calculator for a decimal value of √2, it displays 1.41421356237. What is the meaning of this number? To check whether this square root is correct, what needs\r\nto be done? Can the square root of 2 be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers — for example as 17/12? Before you say “impossible”, consider the ratio 665857/470832\r\n.		2014-08-14 05:02:58.239102	2015-02-04 17:21:13.059297	The number displayed on the calculator is as close as can be gotten given the finite number of decimal places that it can accurately calculate. You can check its correctness by multiplying it by itself, but even if it shows 2 with all zeros afterwards it doesn't mean it is 'correct'. The 'real' square root of two cannot be expressed as a ratio, as it has an infinite number of non-repeating digits, as does pi. It can be expressed to any desired level of precision, which is fine for any kind of actual calculating, so it depends on exactly what is meant by 'express'.	\N	\N	No, it can't	Jaden	Tori, Matt	1

887	8	3	Some terminology: When two angles fit together to form a straight angle (a 180-degree angle, in other words), they are called 'supplementary angles', and either angle is the 'supplement' of the other. When an angle is the same size as its supplement (a 90-degree angle), it is called a 'right angle'. When two angles fit together to form a right angle, they are called 'complementary angles', and either angle is the 'complement' of the other. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be 'perpendicular'.\r\n\r\nThe three angles of a triangle fit together to form a straight angle. In one form or another, this statement is a fundamental postulate of Euclidean geometry — accepted as true, without proof.

1045	1	18	Here are some examples of proofs that do not use coordinates. They all show how specific given information can be used to logically deduce new information. Each example concerns a kite ABCD, for which AB = AD and BC = DC is the given information. The first two proofs show that diagonal AC creates angles BAC and DAC of the same size. The first proof consists of simple text; the second proof is written symbolically as an outline; this statement-reason form is sometimes called a “two-column proof.” \r\nProof A: Because AB = AD and BC = DC, and because the segment AC is shared by the triangles ABC and ADC, it follows from the SSS criterion that these triangles are congruent. Thus it is safe to conclude that the corresponding parts of these triangles are also congruent (often abbreviated to CPCTC, as in proof B below). In particular, angles BAC and DAC are the same size. \r\nProof B: \r\nAB = AD         given\r\nBC = DC         given\r\nAC = AC         shared side \r\nΔABC ∼= ΔADC    SSS\r\n̸ BAC = ̸ DAC     CPCTC\r\n\r\n1.

If the angles are on different sides of the transversal, they are called 'alternate', for example APM and PQD. Angle BPQ is an 'interior' angle because it is between the lines AB and CD, and angle CQT is 'exterior'.

For example, if neighboring red, green, and blue dots are equally bright, the effect is white. If a blue dot is unilluminated and its red and green neighbors are equally bright, the effect is yellow. In other words, white corresponds to the red:green:blue ratio 1/3 : 1/3 : 1/3 and pure yellow corresponds to 1/2 : 1/2 : 0. Notice that the sum of the three terms in each proportion is 1. A triangle RGB provides a simple model for this mixing of colors. The vertices represent three neighboring dots.

Using this data, sketch a graph of the jet’s descent. Is a linear model reasonable to use in this situation? Explain.		2014-07-21 15:43:32.091357	2015-10-26 14:05:57.075133	Not reasonable as stated |\r\nSlope is (36920-21320)/(-120- -90) -> 15600/-30, or -520 (feet per mile). Thus in the remaining 90 miles it would descend 46800 feet if the descent were linear, causing it to hit the ground well before the airport.\r\nIt is not totally unreasonable to use a linear model as the jet has to end at 0,0 and the two points make almost a straight line. However, strictly connecting the points to form a line shows the jet hitting the ground before the airport. In reality the jet probably descends faster at first and has to slow up its descent as it gets closer to the ground.	\N	PBL_ans_25_6n.PNG	Not reasonable as stated	Jordan		1

Suddenly curious about the length of the escalator, Jess returned to the bottom and walked up the same escalator at a leisurely rate, taking steps two thirds as often as on the\r\nfirst trip, taking 56 steps in all. How many steps can be seen on the visible part of the escalator?		2015-07-15 05:22:37.659184	2015-11-02 18:14:48.453017	Check answer\r\nsj has taken 48 steps when fj hits the top, 2/3 of 72, so 24 steps remain on the escalator.\r\nShe must take 56 steps to reach the top, so she has 56-48 of her trip left, or 8 steps. \r\n8 steps is 1/7 of her trip, in that time she will cover 24 steps, so 7 times 24 168 steps.\r\nMy solution:\r\n56 steps at 2/3 the rate is the same as 84 steps at the original rate, so the escalator made 84/72 more steps, i.e. the time was 7/6 longer. So if the original time was 1, the new time would have to be multiplied by 6/7 to equal it.
